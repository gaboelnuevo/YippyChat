// This style of Saga is a common pattern.  It has a
// worker and a watcher.
//
// The watcher listens for the signal, and the worker
// does the job.

// We use a factory function will close over the scope of
// our watcher saga.  This ensures the API is passed in
// (hurray objects being composed).
export default (api) => {
  // ----------
  // The Worker
  // ----------
  // This is our worker.  It does the job.

  function * worker (geolocation) {
    // make the call to the api
    const response = yield call(api.discoverChannels, geolocation)

      yield put(Actions.discoverChannelsSuccess(response.data))
    }else{
      yield put(Actions.discoverChannelsFailed())
    }
  }

  // -----------
  // The Watcher
  // -----------
  // Make a watcher.  It's daemon.  It runs on startup and does
  // a few things:
  //
  // 1.  Goes into a loop to ensure it stays alive.
  // 2.  Listens for ROOM_REQUEST redux events
  // 3.  Unpacks the action.
  // 4.  Calls the worker (above) to do the job.

  // Expose both functions.  Now, technically, we're only
  // needing to return the watcher.  If we return both, we
  // gain 2 important properties:
  //
  // 1.  We can test the worker directly without need to
  // mock the watcher taking.
  //
  // 2.  We can call the worker from other sagas which is
  // often required in some flow control cases.
